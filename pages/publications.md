        Despite growing concerns about heat waves due to climate change and their health impacts, there has been limited research on patterns of extreme heat during summertime and their association with heat-related Emergency Medical Services (EMS) incidents. This study examines spatiotemporal patterns of the heat index (HI) and its relationship to heat-related EMS incidents in Austin-Travis County, Texas, focusing on the summers of 2020 and 2021. Collecting 47,838 heat-related EMS incidence cases and aggregating them at the tract level (N = 290), the research employs spatiotemporal analysis, spatial autocorrelation, K-means clustering, and geographically weighted Poisson regression to identify disparities in heat-related health outcomes. Key findings indicate a significant correlation between high HI frequency and intensity and increased EMS incidents, particularly in East Austin, underscoring the area’s heightened vulnerability to heat. The study also reveals that heat vulnerability and urban growth patterns are closely linked to the incidence of heat-related illnesses, and its impact varies by region. These results emphasize the critical need for targeted heat resilience strategies in urban planning and emergency response. This research merges socio-economic and environmental data to offer insights into heat-related health risks, informing targeted public health policies and urban planning for more equitable and effective interventions.

        Fires and burning are the chief causes of particulate matter (PM2.5), a key measurement of air quality in communities and cities worldwide. This work develops a live fire tracking platform to show active reported fires from over twenty cities in the U.S., as well as predict their smoke paths and impacts on the air quality of regions within their range. Specifically, our close to real-time tracking and predictions culminates in a digital twin to protect public health and inform the public of fire and air quality risk. This tool tracks fire incidents in real-time, utilizes the 3D building footprints of Austin to simulate smoke outputs, and predicts fire incident smoke falloffs within the complex city environment. Results from this study include a complete fire and smoke digital twin model for Austin. We work in cooperation with the City of Austin Fire Department to ensure the accuracy of our forecast and also show that air quality sensor density within our cities cannot validate urban fire presence. We additionally release code and methodology to replicate these results for any city in the world. This work paves the path for similar digital twin models to be developed and deployed to better protect the health and safety of citizens.

        The safety of urban populations sensitive to extreme heat is under increasing threat. Few studies examine the potential benefits of deploying IoT environmental sensors in the urban context and their integration with large-scale human activity data. This paper examines the deployment of IoT sensors in high-resolution extreme heat risk assessment in the case of Seoul, South Korea. This study conducted spatiotemporal analysis on heat exposure with IoT sensors, compared it with an existing land surface temperature map for validation, combined it with human activity data for risk assessment, and finally discussed the benefits of IoTs in detecting abnormal weather events. The results show that extreme heat risks and characteristics vary by age group, and socio-demographic nature overlaps with contextual factors concerning climate risk. This paper discussed possible policy implications to better deal with recurring climate hazards using IoT sensors.
