<h3> URPN202 Building Better Cities (Fall 2021)</h3> [ <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="showdropinfo('URPN202_Fall2021')"></a>Course Description ]

<div id='URPN202_Fall2021' class="abstractcollapsed" style="display:none;">
    This course aims to introduce students to contemporary issues of urbanization, past influences and current practice of public city/urban planning in the United States. One of the many definitions of city planning is “a systematic, creative way to influence the future of neighborhoods, cities, rural and metropolitan areas, an entire nation and even the world” to improve the welfare and quality of life for residents in the community. Planning in this context involves making decisions and taking action related to issues that affect the entire community such as land use, transportation, housing, social services, community and economic development, environmental quality, and so on. Students will learn about the tools, techniques and challenges of being a planner, issues that affect planning, concepts related to planning processes, as well as the various fields of planning. <br><br>
    This course provides a strong foundation for students who wish to pursue advanced study in planning or related disciplines. For those choosing other career paths, this class also aims to provide students with the knowledge and skills that they can use in their desired fields of study and as active citizens in their respective communities.
